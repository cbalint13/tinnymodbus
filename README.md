# TINNYMODBUS (ModBus tiny multi-sensor module)

TinnyModBus is a very small 11x26mm reconfigurable atmel attiny85 mcu based micro-module that speaks modbus over rs485 two wires. It collects measurements locally from large variety of implemented sensors. It can be reprogrammed right on its own rs485 via it's own bootloader.

> Main specs

  - Size is only **11x26 mm** including **screw sockets**
  - Can speak **modbus** with several sensors attached, uses a max487 to communicate
  - Have it's own **500mA** budget, **ESD** protected **rs485** lines, and **reverse-polarity** protection
  - Can read attached sensor data over **1wire**, **i2c**, **spi**, but also could do **gpio** or **adc**
  - Has its own **bootloader** that speaks modbus and can be reprogrammed right on rs485 wires
  - Internal IC metrics like Vcc voltage and SOIC8 temperature are available
  - It is designed to cost less than **2 USD**

> Wiring of TinnyModBus module

Use 4 wires (ideal twisted):

  - 2x @ 12/24V remote power
  - 2x @ A,B rs485

Connects sensors:

  - i2c (any from **/devs** drivers)
  - 1wire (up to 32 18DS20 temperature sensors)
  - or can do **gpio** or **adc**
  - multiple **i2c & 1w** sensors can be **simultaneously** wired
